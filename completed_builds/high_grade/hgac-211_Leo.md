## Lessons Learned
- Use glass file more gently on nubs (causing collateral damage)
- Be more diligent with sanding cement seams - really go through the spectrum of grits
- Have more patience when airbrushing whites - use light coats
  - Conversely white over black primer is difficult to show
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of great with respect to decal placement / alignment
- Take care to be gentle when using knife / any pointed objects (e.g. skewers) around the model
- Look into better masking methods to better cover curves / edges
